This project is not only the result of individual effort but also the reflection of the support, dedication, and belief of everyone who has accompanied me on this journey"

#let resume = "Ce projet porte sur le développement et la mise en œuvre d’un système intégré de GMAO (Gestion de Maintenance Assistée par Ordinateur) et de supervision (SCADA) visant à améliorer la gestion de maintenance au sein de l’usine Lear Corporation de Menzel Bourguiba. L’objectif principal est de digitaliser les processus de maintenance et de centraliser les informations, tout en assurant un suivi en temps réel de l’état des machines via une application web personnalisée. Développée avec le framework Django, la solution propose des interfaces adaptées aux techniciens et aux administrateurs pour la déclaration d’anomalies, le suivi des interventions et la visualisation des données. La communication avec les automates Siemens S7-1200 est assurée par la bibliothèque Snap7, permettant ainsi de remplacer les outils SCADA classiques tels que WinCC par un tableau de bord moderne et accessible à distance. Ce projet s’inscrit pleinement dans une démarche Industrie 4.0 en améliorant la réactivité, en réduisant les temps d’arrêt et en offrant une base évolutive pour la maintenance intelligente."
#let abstract = "This project focuses on the development and implementation of an integrated Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) platform to improve maintenance operations at Lear Corporation's Menzel Bourguiba plant. The objective was to digitize and centralize maintenance processes while enabling real-time monitoring of machine status through a custom-built web application. Developed using Django, the CMMS includes technician and administrator interfaces for intervention tracking, fault reporting, and data visualization. The system is connected to Siemens S7-1200 PLCs using the Snap7 library to retrieve live machine data, replacing traditional SCADA tools like WinCC with a modern, web-based dashboard. This Industry 4.0-oriented solution enhances responsiveness, reduces downtime, and provides a scalable foundation for smart factory maintenance."
