#let dedication = "To my dear father and mother, this graduation report is dedicated to you.
Thank you for your endless love, guidance, and support.
Every step I took in my education was made possible by the strength and care you both have always given me.
Your encouragement helped me overcome challenges and reach new heights. 
I am grateful for the lessons you taught me about hard work, honesty, and kindness.
I hope this work makes you as proud of me as I am proud to be your child.
Thank you for always believing in me.
This achievement is as much yours as it is mine.
I love you both  ."
#let ack = "First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Mr. Mhamdi Abdelbasset, my supervisor, whose expertise, patience, and dedication have been invaluable throughout this project. His insightful guidance, constant encouragement, and availability at every stage helped me overcome challenges and stay focused. His commitment to excellence inspired me to push my limits and grow both technically and personally. I am sincerely grateful for the time and effort he invested in my work.

I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the members of the jury, Ms. Rkhissi Yosra and Mr. Mejri Mohamed Radhouane, for their time, thoughtful feedback, and constructive suggestions. Their critical perspectives and professional insights were essential in refining this project and enhancing its overall quality. I am honored to have had the opportunity to present my work to such knowledgeable and respected individuals.

My sincere appreciation also goes to the professors and academic staff at ISET Bizerte, who have played a crucial role in shaping my knowledge and skills during my years of study. Their support, dedication, and commitment to teaching have provided a strong foundation for my academic and professional journey.

To my classmates and fellow students, thank you for the collaborative spirit, shared experiences, and motivation throughout our studies. Working alongside you has been a rewarding and memorable part of my time at ISET Bizerte.

I am profoundly grateful to my family for their unconditional love, patience, and belief in me. Their constant support and sacrifices made this achievement possible. A special thank you to my friends, who stood by me, encouraged me through the most stressful moments, and celebrated every milestone along the way.

This project is not only the result of individual effort but also the reflection of the support, dedication, and belief of everyone who has accompanied me on this journey"

#let resume = "Ce projet décrit la mise en œuvre d’un système basé sur le web de l’Internet industriel des objets (IIoT) pour la surveillance en temps réel et la gestion de la maintenance d’une machine de tri industrielle contrôlée par API Siemens S7-1200. Le système combine l’acquisition de données au niveau de la machine avec une application Web sur mesure, permettant aux opérateurs et au personnel de maintenance de visualiser l’état de la machine, le nombre de productions et les conditions de panne en temps réel. Les données sont collectées à partir de l’API via l’edge computing basé sur Python et transmises à une plate-forme Web alimentée par Django où elles sont affichées et enregistrées. L’application dispose également d’un module de système de gestion de la maintenance assistée par ordinateur (GMAO), qui permet de générer automatiquement des interventions de maintenance en réponse aux pannes de la machine. Cette solution offre une alternative peu coûteuse et évolutive aux systèmes SCADA conventionnels et illustre l’application pratique des principes de l’industrie 4.0 dans les environnements de fabrication intelligents."
#let abstract = "This project describes the implementation of an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) web-based system for real-time monitoring and maintenance management of a Siemens S7-1200 PLC-controlled industrial sorting machine. The system combines machine-level data acquisition with a bespoke web application, enabling operators and maintenance staff to view machine status, production counts, and fault conditions in real-time. Data is gathered from the PLC via Python-based edge computing and forwarded to a Django-powered web platform where it is displayed and logged. The app also features a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) module, which allows for automatic generation of maintenance interventions in response to machine faults. This solution offers a low-cost, scalable alternative to conventional SCADA systems and illustrates the practical application of Industry 4.0 principles in smart manufacturing environments."
